  + *HeightData.current.xlsx*: current height data workbook, including the collection templates
  + *heightdatauptoC30.xlsx*: older height data
  + *RootData.xlsx*: root data workbook, used to collect information about the success of each clone generation
  + *Maternal Plants Scan and Map.xlsx*: maternal plant map and scan, used to collect inventory update information every crop cycle
  + *Clone Scan and Map*: clone map and scan, used to collect inventory update information and root data templates every crop cycle
  + *Miniveg Range and Map*: miniveg map, used to collect inventory update information every crop cycle
  + *MASTER PRUNE MAP*: prune map and scan, used to communicate and track the pruning approaches to each type of plant in a room
  + *Week 1 Trellis Assignments.xlsx*: used to determine, communicate, and track the trellising approaches to each type of plant in a room for week 1
  + *Week 3 Trellis Assignments.xlsx*: used to determine, communicate, and track the trellising approaches to each type of plant in a room for week 3
  + *BudWidth.xlsx*: bud width, a workbook in development used to record and track the bud widths of plants at the end of their flowering cycle
  + *GrowthWorkbook.xlsx*: growth workbook, a legacy collection of growth and node development data
  + *C#_template_v.20329*: crop generation workbook template, a collaborative project that gathered all available datasets for each crop generation
